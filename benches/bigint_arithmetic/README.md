# bigint_arithmetic
Multiplying numbers larger than what's possible with a normal 64 bit processor.

* **Baseline**: Add 1 + 1
* **Fact50**: Take the factorial of 50. (Gets up to 256 bits)
* **Fact95**: Take the factorial of 95. (Gets up to 512 bits)

Note: We cannot include GMP or unstable crates. GMP can't be included because it is not crossplatform (not available in Windows).

| | baseline | fact50 | fact95 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[num_bigint](https://crates.io/crates/num_bigint)** | 0.118 | *9.967* | *28.302* |
| **[numext_fixed_uint](https://crates.io/crates/numext_fixed_uint)** | *0.008* | 70.449 | 424.15 |
| **[uint](https://crates.io/crates/uint)** | 0.016 | 115.803 | 903.362 |

Speed units are in microseconds per iteration. Less is better.
