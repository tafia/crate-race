# vec_intsort
Sorting Vecs of u32.

* *Baseline*: 1 item.
* *Sorted*: 10,000 items, fully sorted already.
* *Random*: 10,000 items, randomly shuffled. (The shuffling is not part of the time).
* *Reverse*: 10,000 items, sorted in reverse order.

Speed units are in microseconds per iteration. Less is better.
