Speed units are in microseconds per iteration.

* Baseline: Searching "abc123" inside of "1abc123"
* Big_Pattern: Search for a 50kb string inside of "1" + the 50kb string. Chars for this string were random.
* Monotonous: 50kb string of all 1s. Find "abc123" at the end.
* Almost: 50kb string repeating "abc12" without the ending "3". Find "abc123" at the end of the string.

Crate versions tested:

    jetscii = "0.4.3"    # A tiny library to efficiently search strings and byte slices for sets of ASCII characters or bytes.
    subslice = "0.2.0"          # Fast subslice search
    twoway = "0.2.0"        # Fast substring search for strings and byte strings. Optional SSE4.2 acceleration (if detected at runtimâ€¦
    galil-seiferas = "0.1.5"    # General string search in constant space, linear time, for nonorderable alphabets.
    aho-corasick = "0.6.9"      # Fast multiple substring searching with finite state machines.
