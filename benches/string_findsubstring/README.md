# string_findsubstring
Search for the position of a string inside of a string.

* **Baseline**: Searching "abc123" inside of "1abc123"
* **Big_Pattern**: Search for a 50kb string inside of "1" + the 50kb string. Chars for this string were random.
* **Monotonous**: 50kb string of all 1s. Find "abc123" at the end.
* **Almost**: 50kb string repeating "abc12" without the ending "3". Find "abc123" at the end of the string.
