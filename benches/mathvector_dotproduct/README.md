# mathvector_dotproduct
Doing a dot product operation on different size vectors. All floats.

* *Baseline*: 3 dimension vector * 3 dimension vector
* *Hundred*: 100 dimension vector * 100 dimension vector
* *Thousand*: 1000 dimension vector * 1000 dimension vector

Note - `cgmath` and `vek` doesn't allow to do more than 4 dimensions.

| | baseline | hundred | thousand |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[cgmath](https://crates.io/crates/cgmath)** | *0* | - | - |
| **[vek](https://crates.io/crates/vek)** | 0 | - | - |
| **[rulinalg](https://crates.io/crates/rulinalg)** | 0.067 | *0.117* | 0.647 |
| **[ndarray](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray)** | 0.073 | 0.13 | *0.642* |
| **[nalgebra](https://crates.io/crates/nalgebra)** | 0.009 | 0.201 | 1.132 |

Speed units are in microseconds per iteration. Less is better.
