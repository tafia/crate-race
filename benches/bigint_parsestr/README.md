# bigint_parsestr
Parsing large numbers from strings.

* **Baseline**: Convert "1" string into a number, and then back into a string again.
* **Big_num**: Convert a 149 digit string into a number, and then back into a string again.

| | baseline | big_num |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[num_bigint](https://crates.io/crates/num_bigint)** | 0.284 | *1.266* |
| **[numext_fixed_uint](https://crates.io/crates/numext_fixed_uint)** | *0.148* | 99.761 |
| **[uint](https://crates.io/crates/uint)** | 0.154 | 957.266 |

Speed units are in microseconds per iteration. Less is better.
